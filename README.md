# AI-Powered Email Intelligence System

## Overview
Thi is an email response platform that leverages natural language processing and a large language model to provide intelligent, personalized email communications. By analyzing the sentiment and content of incoming emails, SentientMail generates appropriate, context-aware responses that maintain your unique tone and style.

## Key Features
- Automated email response generation
- Sentiment analysis for tailored messaging
- Seamless integration with existing email workflows
- Customizable response templates and guidelines
- 24/7 availability for prompt customer communications

## How It Works
1. Email is received and processed by the system.
2. Natural language processing analyzes the email content, identifying factors like key topics, tone, and urgency.
3. The system dynamically generates a personalized prompt based on the email context and your communication preferences.
4. The prompt is passed to a large language model (e.g., ChatGPT) to produce a draft response.
5. The response is formatted to match your style, including appropriate greetings, sign-offs, and formatting.
6. The finalized email is securely sent to the original recipient.
